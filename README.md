## Entry Points for Contributors

**Start anywhere. Fork freely. No permission needed.**

### Story Entry Points

- Write a scene where a character attempts a 'digital sabbath' for 24 hours, documenting the physical and psychological withdrawal symptoms.
- Create a character profile for a modern 'beat'—a figure who rejects the algorithmic curation of life. What is their manifesto? How do they navigate the city?
- Draft a stream-of-consciousness monologue from the perspective of a notification, a data packet, or a blinking cursor.
- Imagine a hidden, physical space in a city (like The Last Call bar) that serves as a sanctuary from the network. Describe its rules, its patrons, and a pivotal conversation that happens there.

### Technical Entry Points

- Build a simple text-based 'anxiety simulator' that mimics a social media feed or notification stream, allowing the user to experience the overwhelming cascade described in the novel.
- Create a 'writing jammer' tool—a local, offline text editor with a minimalist, immutable interface designed to eliminate the anxiety of the blank page and the saving/deleting cycle.
